<summary><strong>About</strong></summary>
<br>
The UnitTestr unit testing framework is a multi function 
testing framework that allows for many ways to test things.
<br> <br>
We aim to be a one-stop-shop for all types of testing, UI Testing, 
API testing, and hopefully soon regression and accessability testing

<br> <br> 
<strong>This Framework was created by a student, so please be nice</strong>
